 This model is a U-PTA.
 Model: `example2.imi`
 Algorithm: safety synthesis
 Merging technique of [AFS13] enabled.
 Starting running algorithm AG…
 
 Computing post^1 from 1 state.
 Computing post^2 from 1 state.
 Computing post^3 from 1 state.
 Computing post^4 from 1 state.
   [AG] Found a new target state.
 Computing post^5 from 1 state.
   [AG] Found a new target state.
 
 Fixpoint reached at a depth of 6: 7 states with 7 transitions in the final state space.
 
   [AG] Algorithm completed after 0.003 second.
 
 Final positive constraint guaranteeing safety:
  85 >= u
 & v >= 0
 & u >= 0
 & 85 >= v
 This positive constraint is exact (sound and complete)
 
 Result written to file `example2.res`.
