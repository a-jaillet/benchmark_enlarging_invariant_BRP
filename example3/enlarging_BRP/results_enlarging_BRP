Calculating the distance...
d <  100
d <  50
d <  37
d <  36
d >=  35

Distance found: 35 <= d < 36

Result found in 70.957 seconds.

C-non-blocking: True

C-structurely-enabled-edges: True

C-cycle-first: l3 = 0

Constraint due to the distance: l2 + l3 < 70

Global constraint to keep the bounded response property:  l2 + l3 < 70 & l3 = 0
