 This model is a U-PTA.
 Model: `example6.imi`
 Algorithm: safety synthesis
 Merging technique of [AFS13] enabled.
 Starting running algorithm AG…
 
 Computing post^1 from 1 state.
 Computing post^2 from 1 state.
   [AG] Found a new target state.
 Computing post^3 from 2 states.
   [AG] Found a new target state.
   [AG] Found a new target state.
 Computing post^4 from 1 state.
 
 Fixpoint reached at a depth of 5: 8 states with 8 transitions in the final state space.
 
   [AG] Algorithm completed after 0.004 second.
 
 Final positive constraint guaranteeing safety:
  5 >= u
 & u >= 0
 & v >= 0
 & 80 >= u + v
 This positive constraint is exact (sound and complete)
 
 Result written to file `example6.res`.
