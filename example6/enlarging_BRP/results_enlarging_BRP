Calculating the distance...
d <  100
d <  50
d >=  25
d >=  37
d <  43
d >=  40
d <  41
d >=  40

Distance found: 40 <= d < 41

Result found in 0.834 seconds.

C-non-blocking: True

C-structurely-enabled-edges: l1 < 5 & l3 = 0

C-cycle-first: True

Constraint due to the distance: l1 + l2 < 80

Global constraint to keep the bounded response property:  l1 + l2 < 80 & l1 < 5 & l3 = 0
